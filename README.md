### Branching and Releases

The `master` branch is the default branch for pull requests and most other development activities. 

Releases are based on a stable `master` branch. Use of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is encouraged.

Stride Website is _not_ released under a regular cadence; new updates arrive when maintainers fix issues or see enough changes that warrant a new release. Sometimes we use pre-releases to get feedback from the community.

### Staging

The staging website allows us to test new features and significant changes before their official release.

The staging website is available at [Stride Website Staging](https://stride-website-staging.azurewebsites.net/).
