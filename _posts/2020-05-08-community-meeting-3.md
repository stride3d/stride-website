On May the 8th we held another community meeting in the Discord. It's main goal was to talk about the ongoing work on Stride and its first official release after the rename to Stride.

## Summary ##
- Official Stride 4.0 release. The plan is to release Stride 4.0 officially within the next 2 weeks. It depends a little on whether .Net 3.1 is going to be part of it. If this can be done within reasonable time, than we rather incorporate this in to the official release of 4.0
    - The release notes will be written in a more friendly way.
    - Aggror will look into making a video regarding the release as well some of the new key features like VXGI cone tracing.
- Xen2 has filled in the application for joining the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/), a non-profit organization (NPO). At the moment of writing this blog, no response on this yet.
- Roadmap The github [roadmap](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/projects/3) will be updated. From now on it will only contain features that Xen2 or others will actively work on. This means some epics will be removed from the roadmap, and some new ones will be added. The epics that are removed will still be visible as requests in Github issues.
- There is now a `stride` tag on gamedev.stackexchange (tag might be changed to `stride-engine` soon btw). We can use this site for Q&A and additional "How to? questions. https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stride
- Documentation
    - Recording of [C# beginner video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRZx2y7uC8mNySUMfOQf-TLNVnnHkLfPi) is ongoing. Videos are listed on the official Stride Youtube account. Basically every page will have an accompanied video. The playlist is being updated on the go.
    - Started making the C# intermediate tutorial section.
    - Continuation of the editor video tutorials once the programming tutorials are up to speed again.
- Some people showed interest in working on a community showcase demo for Stride. A new discord channel #showcasing-team was created.
