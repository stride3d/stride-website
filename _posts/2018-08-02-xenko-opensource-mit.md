You read that right. <b>Xenko 3.0</b> is out now, released under the permissive <b><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a></b>. 

From now on, you can use and modify Xenko completely <b>free</b> — whether you're a professional, a student, or just looking for a new hobby. This includes both the runtime and editor.

Main focus for this release was on the open-source transition, but Xenko 3.0 also includes some new features, such as a switch to the new C# project system, video, hair and skin rendering.
Read the full release notes [here](https://doc.stride3d.net/3.0/en/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotes.html).

<a href="https://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/en">Silicon Studio</a> no longer supports Xenko, but members of the Xenko team will continue to work on it independently as part of the community. More specifically, I will personally work on it fulltime for the next few months to see if it picks up some steam as a community project. Kudos to Silicon Studio for starting and supporting the project so far! Turning the project open-source and community-driven is a fantastic achievement.

This project will live <b>thanks to its community</b> and will have its own GitHub organization. Want to <b>contribute</b>? Join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/)!

We're proud of everything we and our users have achieved with Xenko over the last three years. We can't wait to see what you do with it next!
