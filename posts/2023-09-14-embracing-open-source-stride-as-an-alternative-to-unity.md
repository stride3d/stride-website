## Introduction to Stride

Stride is not just another game engine; it's written entirely in C# and serves as a powerful platform in the .NET ecosystem. This unique focus on C# offers developers the native .NET tooling and functionalities they are already comfortable with. What sets Stride apart is its project structure; Stride projects are standard `csproj` files, allowing them to integrate effortlessly into your existing .NET solutions.

## Difference Between Unity and Stride

Unity is developed by a large team and offers a feature-rich experience. On the other hand, [Stride](https://github.com/stride3d) is open-source and built by community contributors. 

This means that Stride might not have all the features that Unity has, simply because there aren't as many people working on it. However, the open-source nature of Stride allows you to customize it according to your needs and provides a solid foundation for any rendering project.

Additionally, Stride allows you to utilize any [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Stride) package and even provides access to the `Main` function of your game. You can also find useful resources such as documentation, community toolkits, and guides for migrating from Unity to Stride.

- [Stride for Unity Developers](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/stride-for-unity-developers/index.html)

## Licensing

Stride is released under the **MIT** license, which is important because it grants you significant freedoms to use, modify, and distribute the engine.

## What game were made using Stride?

For examples of games developed using Stride, check out [Made with Stride](https://github.com/Doprez/Awesome-Stride#made-with-stride) section.

## Operating System Support

- Editor: Windows
- Runtime: Windows, Linux, <span class="text-warning">macOS</span>, Android, iOS

## IDE Support

Stride games are "standard" C# projects, meaning you can use a variety of IDEs:

- VSCode
- Visual Studio 2022
- Rider
- Blocknote + MsBuild
- VVVV

> **Note:** There's a Visual Studio extension for syntax highlighting, shader build keys and error checking.

> **Note:** Another extension offers syntax highlighting only.

## Multiplayer Support

Stride does not offer built-in multiplayer or Server/Client architecture. However, you can easily integrate any .NET networking library to implement these features. You have the freedom to choose from a variety of libraries and resources. For a curated list, you can check out [Awesome-Stride's Networking section](https://github.com/Doprez/Awesome-Stride#networking).

## Unity Assets

You can import some 3D models from the Unity store into Stride. However, scripts will need modification since the two engines differ.

These are the [Scripting differences](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/stride-for-unity-developers/index.html#event-functions-start-update-execute-etc) simply:
- `StartupScript` is a MonoBehaviour without the Update method that's not run every frame
- `SyncScript` is a MonoBehaviour that runs every frame
- `AsyncScript` is unique and run per-frame asynchronously

## Screen Capture

To capture a frame, you can use the following code snippet:


```csharp
var commandList = GraphicsContext.CommandList;

commandList.RenderTarget.Save(commandList, stream, ImageFileType.Png);
```

## Shaders Available
Yes. SDSL, written on top of HLSL.

- [Shading language](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/graphics/effects-and-shaders/shading-language/index.html)
- https://github.com/tebjan/Stride.ShaderExplorer

## Build Automation
Yes, since Stride uses .NET, automating the build process works out-of-the-box.

## Add-ons and Extensions
You can not extend the editor in the same way as Unity but you can create custom code extensions as seen in the following:
- [Terrain add-on](https://github.com/johang88/TR.Stride)
- [Level editor add-on](https://github.com/Basewq/XenkoProofOfConcepts/tree/master/LevelEditorExtensionExample)

## Transformations

The [`TransformComponent`](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/api/Stride.Engine.TransformComponent.html) class in Stride is a fundamental component for representing an entity's position, rotation, and scale within a 3D scene.

**Important Features:**

- **`LocalMatrix` and `WorldMatrix`**: These matrices manage the transformations of the entity.
- **`Position`, `Rotation`, and `Scale`**: These properties represent the entity's position, rotation, and scale in the local coordinate system. The `Position` property is a [`Vector3`](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/api/Stride.Core.Mathematics.Vector3.html), defining the entity's position. The `Rotation` property uses a `Quaternion` to represent the entity's rotation, and the `Scale` property is a `Vector3` that sets the scale. You can modify these properties to transform the entity.
- **`UpdateLocalMatrix()` and `UpdateWorldMatrix()`**: These methods update the local and world matrices, respectively.
- **`Parent` and `Children`**: These properties allow you to establish parent-child relationships between entities, affecting their transformations accordingly.

## Rendering
Stride primarily uses **clustered** forward rendering, with some additional features. Read more in the docs.

## Other Q&A

### What is Coroutine in Stride?
Unlike Unity, which uses `IEnumerator` for asynchronous code execution, Stride leverages C#'s built-in `await` and `async` features. This can be accomplished using `AsyncScript`, which essentially acts as a `SyncScript` (the Stride equivalent of Unity's MonoBehaviour) but with asynchronous methods. You can use async methods within sync scripts, the same as standard C#.

### What is a StartupScript?
A `StartupScript` in Stride includes a `Start` method that is invoked when it's added to the scene tree. This is similar to Unity's `Start` or `Awake` methods. However, `StartupScript` does not contain `Update` methods and therefore doesn't execute code every frame.

### Using Other Assemblies/Projects in Stride
In Unity, the packaging system is built on top of a `csproj` file, which allows Unity to protect its proprietary source code. Stride, however, grants you full access to your `csproj` and `sln` (Solution) files. This enables you to include any NuGet packages or other C# projects in the usual way, by adding project references. If you add a new subproject to your main project through the Stride editor, it will be correctly configured by default, including folder location and references to the Stride engine.

### Is There an Asset Store for Stride?
No, Stride does not have a dedicated Asset Store. However, most additional libraries specially designed for Stride can be found on GitHub or NuGet. For easier discovery, a summary has been made available at [Awesome-Stride](https://github.com/Doprez/Awesome-Stride).

### Null Checking in Stride vs Unity
Does `is null` and `== null` work? Unlike Unity, which has overridden the `Equals` operator to be compatible with its C++ engine, Stride allows you to use `is null` and `== null` to compare the existence of an Entity or Component directly.
