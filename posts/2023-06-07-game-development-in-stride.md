Just a little reminder that Stride has been presented in a .NET Live! 🎥🎥🎥

[Vaclav](https://github.com/VaclavElias), [Tebjan](https://github.com/tebjan) and I participated in a .NET live session to showcase the Stride engine, as well as some work done by users. Many questions were asked, and [Manio](https://github.com/manio143) answered many of them in the chat.

## The most important questions answered

In this live session, we answered the most important questions about the project, including how to use Stride and what it aims to be!

Tebjan presented a bit about what contributors have done and what users (professionals/hobbyists, artists/developers) have done so far to show off the capabilities of the engine. He also gave a small presentation on how Stride is used with [VVVV](https://vvvv.org/) for 3D rendering!

## A fun experimentation

Vaclav, having dived into Stride with a desire to use Stride without an editor, created an API to experiment and create games using just a NuGet package. He presents his NuGet package, explains how to use it, and how to make games leveraging the power of .NET and hot reloading!

ToDo @vaclav: Add some further description, maybe a code snippet

## Shaders

I've personally become interested in the shader system of Stride and found it refreshingly easy to use. I decided to show more about how to use shaders, update them, and extend the rendering engine of Stride.

### What is a shader?

ToDo @youness: Write your explanation and link to our existing documentation if we have got anything related to shaders. Interlinking with existing tutorials, manual, previous posts is very important if it is possible.

### Shader code

```
// ToDo @youness Add your shader sample?
```

## Closing

We strongly recommend watching this live session, as it will help you gain a better understanding of Stride. .NET is becoming more and more relevant for a game engine, as evident with Stride. Don't hesitate to reach out to our community through the [Discord]({{ site.links.discord-url }}) server!
