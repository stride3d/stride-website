We're excited to announce that vvvv has released a new 3D engine for vvvv, our visual live-programming environment for .NET. Named "VL.Stride," it is essentially a wrapper around the Stride engine and can be used independently from the Stride Game Studio.

Read more about the release and its details in this [release blog post](https://vvvv.org/blog/vl.stride-for-evvvveryone).

Note that vvvv's focus is not on creating games but rather on creative coding and interaction design style of applications. But due to its live-programming nature, using a state hot-reload approach, it may still be interesting for you to quickly prototype some functionality for your games. Also vvvv can help you explore all the different parts of the Stride engine and understand how they work together. Being able to touch all parts while they are running, allows to get an overview faster than just going through Stride's documentation. 

We'd like to invite you to play with it and hear your feedback. vvvv is free for non-commercial use, no strings attached. So please just go ahead, [download vvvv gamma 2020.3-preview](http://visualprogramming.net/) and let us know what you think!

## NODE20
If you're already convinced and want to learn more about vvvv, join us for [30 online workshops](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/workshops/) covering various topics, we're running during the [NODE20 - Forum for Digital Arts](https://20.nodeforum.org/) from October 3rd to 8th.

- [Realtime graphics with Stride 3D – The Fundamentals](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=fdmYwsGOetD3L7Vs7Iph)
- [Patching Materials](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=fzhQkCecOIp6kU6WsLiO)
- [Beyond Sound and Visual](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=nO7aO8hdYv14R1PiBPBp)
- [VL.Stride Deepdive](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=NNA9Lhd4ICiw6VIzlFAr)

- [Working with the Stride GameStudio](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=RVC2tTBN3u4EXgGc8x5W)

As you can see, with vvvv we're quite invested in Stride. We bow before everyone who helped to make it what it is today and want to do our best to contribute our share to give it a bright future. 

Yours, vvvv.
