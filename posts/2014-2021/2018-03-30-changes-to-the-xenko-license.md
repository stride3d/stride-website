Long time no see!

The Xenko promotion period has ended, and we've made some changes to the license plans.

* As of 1 April 2018, Xenko Pro and Xenko Pro Plus are no longer available.

* Xenko Personal is still **free** for personal use and for businesses of less than $200,000 US in annual revenue. If you don't meet the Xenko Personal criteria, [contact us](http://stride3d.net/contact) for a custom plan.

* If your business makes over $200,000 US in annual revenue, and you downloaded Xenko before 1 April 2018, you can continue to use Xenko until 1 April 2019. If you want to use Xenko after that, you need to [contact us](http://stride3d.net/contact) to create a custom plan before 1 April 2019.

For more information, see the [FAQ](https://stride3d.net/faq/).

Meanwhile, we're exploring the idea of a version of Xenko run entirely by the community. We also have a bunch of updates we're excited to show you, which we'll release once we finish exploring licensing options.

We know it's been a long wait for Xenko users. We really appreciate your patience.
